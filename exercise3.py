# Exercise 2

# This line prints a statement
print("I will now count my chickens:")
# This line does a division before the addition
print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
# This line does the multiplication and modulus before subtraction
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)
# This line prints another statement to count the eggs
print("Now I will count the eggs:")
# This line performs the arithimetic operations starting with the modulus and division before the addition and subtraction
print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
# This line asks a question
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")
# And prints out the value of the boolean expression
print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)
# This line asks for the value of the sum of 2 and 3 and outputs the value
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
# This line does the subtraction
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)
# This line prints another statement
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")
# Same as the expression below
print("How about some more.")
# This line asks a question which evaluates to the booloean expression true
print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
# This also evaluates to true because 5 is greater than 2
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
# This evaluates to false because 5 is not less than or equal to 2
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)
